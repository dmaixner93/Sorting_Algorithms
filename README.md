# Sorting_Algorithms

**Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection of data so that the items are in order (smallest to largest, highest to lowest, etc.)**.

When it comes to data, their are many ways to actually sort it. Before sorting the data, the user will need to take into account the present state of the data, the type of data, and the amount of data. Knowing these key factors will depend on the method that is used to actually sort the data.

The types of sorting algorithms that will be discussed in this repository are:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort

## Bubble Sort

**Time complexity: O(n) - Best case
                   O(n^2) - Average/worst case

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm where the largest values "bubble" to the "top" of the data.

## Selection Sort

**Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Selection sort is very similar to bubble sort, the main difference instead of the larger values being places at the top the smallest numbers will be placed at the top of the data.

## Insertion Sort
